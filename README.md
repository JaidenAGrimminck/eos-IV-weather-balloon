# eos-IV-weather-balloon

EOS-IV was a weather balloon that we (Sean Kuwamoto and Jaiden Grimminck) put our own flight computer on to collect data. Our flight computer was based on a Feather M0 and coded with C++/Arduino. The flight computer's sensors were an 24x24 infrared camera, temperature sensor, accelerometer, and a GPS. For the success of the flight, the computer was active for majority of it until it suddenly shutoff sometime midflight. We believe this might have been due to a potential issue with the SD card or potentially loosing power.


## Jaiden's Simulation

For my final part of the project, I created a VR Unity showcase to show the path of the weather balloon for visitors. Here's an example video of this sim:
